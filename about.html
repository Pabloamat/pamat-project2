               <p>Pablo Amat is a New Orleans based artist, songwriter, and keyboardist. His story starts all the way across the Atlantic, in Spain. <br>
                 He was born and raised in Madrid and started piano lessons at the age of 7. He played the usual “Chopsticks” and simple tunes. His father <br>
                 is a musician, a big producer in Spain who worked with many people. Music runs in the family.<br><br>

                At the age of 10 however, him and his family had to move to Miami due to the 2008 economic crisis. This was a massive change for the Amat <br>
                family. They left their friends, home and family to build a new life in the United States. The first year was rough, it affected all of <br>
                them. The new language, people and culture was hard to get used to so Pablo decided to stop playing piano. At the age of 15 he discovered <br>
                a new love and appreciation for music. He started listening to big rock artists like Billy Joel and Queen. This re-awakened his love for the <br>
                piano and started teaching himself the tunes. Once in Loyola, he realized he would need something more to further his musical abilities, so <br>
                he's been studying jazz as a minor. <br><br>
                
                He has worked with many local artists like Gabe Parsons, Mynthia and CM Young. Currently, he has started his own project playing his <br>
                original music with a killer band. All there is left to say is watch out, because he's going to rock this town!
